# React Comienzo
A starter app using:
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

The app has 2 routes: `/` and `/accessibility`. The homepage includes a [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax), which can be disabled by the user in `/accessibility`.

A [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) is included, but in order to use you must include an SSL certificate. Free certificates are available at [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Store `key.pem` and `cert.pem` in root.
